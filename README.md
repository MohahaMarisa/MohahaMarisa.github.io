This is my portfolio from sophomore year of college til senior year. After graduation
I took down most of the pages because all the little inconsistencies in style/writing/documentation 
built up over the years irritated me. 

The plan was to clean it up and put things back the summer after graduation but the motivation dried up as other things took priority.
